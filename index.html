    ""My opinion of Materialist interpretation of history, and in the material development of social formations.""
 
 
 </h1>
 <p>
     Starting from Marxist analysis emphasizes the determining nature of material conditions - social relations and places in production - in people's lives and in the consciousness they have about themselves and the world. This material base is considered the ultimate determinant of other social phenomena, such as social and political relations, law, ideology or morality.
